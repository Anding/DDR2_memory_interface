PHY
==============

Brief explanation of these signals?
	wrrd_ba_add : in std_logic_vector(2 downto 0);
	wrrd_ras_add : in std_logic_vector(12 downto 0);
	wrrd_cas_add : in std_logic_vector(8 downto 0);
	
=> addresses (bank, column, row) 
=> the other address is not used
	
A little explanation of this logic
	clk_int_xor <= clk_int_fall XOR clk_int_rise; 
	clk_int_xor_delay <= clk_int_xor after 300 ps; 
	
=> trick to route out a clock from the FPGA
=> AFTER 300ps is not synthesized (that bit simply skipped), limit errors from the Micron model

Touch on how these are working?
	ODDR
	IDDR
	
=> Registers at the IO (DDR registers)
=> One output, two inputs  (checks Xilinx documentation)


Can I ask what you are meaning here?
	DQS-out (FPGA to SDRAM) single ended
	DQS-in (SDRAM to FPGA) skipped

=> Somehow these strobes need to be toggled at a point in time to indicate date valid
=> Routing is complicated since timing needs to match DQS and Data


Refresh mechanism
=================

What does this comment mean
	if (refresh_time_cnt = 640000) then -- should work 10-times slower  
=> every 64ms must be a refresh (currently 6.4ms)
	
Clocking
========
 
What do you do with clk_100_111 and clk_100_91?
Could we brefly talk about p4, 5, 6 of overview.pdf

Optimizations
=============

I would like to attempt some of these, esp. byte select
Brief discussion on approach?
