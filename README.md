# DDR2_memory_interface
A DDR2 memory interface for the Digilent Nexys4 board that does not rely on the Xilinx MIG.  This project is based on a working DDR2 interface very kindly donated by a friend.  Please note that this is currently an _unfinished implementation_ with a number of serious limitations.
